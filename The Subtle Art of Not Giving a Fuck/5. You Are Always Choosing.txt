You Are Always Choosing
>> The only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it and that we 
are responsible for it.

THE CHOICE
>> All growth emerges from the simple realization that no matter what external circumstances are happening, we 
are responsible for everything in our lives. We don't always control what happens to us, but we can always choose
how we interpret what happens to us.
>> Responsibility is a value, one that is useful to live a meaningful life.

THE RESPONSIBILITY/FAULT FALACY
>> "With great responsibility comes great power". The more responsibility we take for our own life the more power we'll
have our it.
>> Some things are not your fault, but they still are your responsibility.
>> The things that happen to you, that are not your fault, that you have to fix, that's ok, it has been your responsibility
all along and you need to own that. But learn, think about the stuff that you did wrong, think about what you could do
better from now on. And remember that this world is a place of abundance, and there are a million open doors.

RESPONDING TO TRAGEDY:
>> It sucks, but it still your responsibility to get out of the hole. That's life.

GENETICS AND THE HAND WE'RE DEALT
>> Make the most of what you're given. No one chooses, some get lucky some don't. Deal with it.

THERE IS NO "HOW"
>> How do i change? Well, like Yoda said: Do, or do not; there is no [how].
>> Choosing and changing may not be easy, but it is simple. It is as simple as choosing. People get hung up on looking for the best strategies to change and the best plans
and the best groups and the best helpers but the reality is that it is as simple as choosing and sticking to the choice. It is simple, not easy.
>> Change is painful and uncomfortable, you experience doubt and feelings of failure and you lose people. This is part of changing and its alright.


** Basically this chapter is about choosing what to give a fuck about and being responsible for everything in your life, even when it was not your fault.
