YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING (BUT SO AM I):
>> Being able to recognize that you're wrong about some things means you've grown.
>> Learning we don't go from wrong to right, we go from wrong to slightly less wrong (iteratively).
>> Wrong isn't about adopting the right ways (cause you don't know what those are), it's more about leaving the bad ways (because you know they are bad).
>> Certainty is the enemy of growth. Accepting the inevitable imperfections of our values is necessary for any growth to take place.
>> Instead of looking to be right, we should look for how we're wrong, cause we are wrong.

* How am i wrong?

ARCHITECTS OF OUR OWN BELIEFS:
>> Our brains are meaning machines. Meaning is generated by the associations our brain makes between two or more experiences or concepts.
>> Our brains are imperfect, they forget, misinterpret, etc. The result is that many of the meanings or beliefs we construct are wrong. More exactly, all are wrong, some are just less 
wrong than others.

BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU BELIEVE:
>> Our memories suck. Our brains are horribly biased, we're always trying to make sense of our current situation based on what we already believe and have already experienced.
>> Doubt your beliefs and your mind especially when it makes you believe you're a victim and someone else is responsible for your situation.

THE DANGERS OF PURE CERTAINTY:
>> Evil people never believe that they are evil; rather, they believe that everyone else is evil.
>> Believing that you deserve something, that you're entitled to anything its dangerous, you might be willing to cheat or to take things violently.
>> The more you embrace being uncertain and now knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don't know.

* What do i feel like i have a need to be certain about?

>> Uncertainty is the root of all progress and growth. The way to achieve things is to remain uncertain of them and be open to finding them out through experience.
>> Our values are imperfect and incomplete, and to assume that they are perfect and complete is to put us in a dangerous dogmatic mindset that breeds entitlement and avoids 
responsibility.
>> The only way to solve our problems is to first admit that our actions and beliefs up to this point have been wrong and are not working.

MANSON'S LAW OF AVOIDANCE:
"The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it"
>> There is a certain comfort that comes with knowing how you fit in the world. Anything that shakes up that comfort, even if it could potentially make your life better 
- is inherently scary.
>> Maybe you're more than you believe, maybe you're less, maybe you'll never know, but that's what will allow you to keep searching.

KILL YOURSELF:
* What are my self-limiting beliefs? What identity am i trying to protect?
>> Define yourself in the simplest and most ordinary ways possible.
>> You're not special, and that's ok, it is a good thing.

HOW TO BE A LITTLE LESS CERTAIN OF YOURSELF:
1. What if I'm wrong?
Not because you ask this question it means that you actually are wrong, or at least completely wrong. But it's worth remembering that for any change to happen in your life, you must be
wrong about something first.
2. What would it mean if I were wrong?
3. Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?
