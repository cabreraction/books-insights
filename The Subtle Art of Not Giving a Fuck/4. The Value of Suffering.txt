THE VALUE OF SUFFERING:
If suffering is inevitable, the question we should be asking is "Why am i suffering? For what purpose?"

THE SELF AWARENESS ONION:
Self awareness has at least three layers (like an onion)
>> Layer 1: You are able to tell what you're Feeling
>> Layer 2: You're able to tell why you're feeling that way.
>> Layer 3: You're able to tell why your values constitute your values. This is why you believe what you do.

- Why do i feel like i need a girl by my side? How do i determine what success/failure is?
- Why do i feel like i wanna leave this country and go make a life somewhere else?
- Why do i feel like i need to impress other people? Specially when i'm well aware that no one cares.

ROCK STAR PROBLEMS:
>> Our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves.
>> If you want to change how you see your problems you have to change what you value and/or how you measure 
failure/sucess.
>> Some values and metric are better than others (but why?!), but it's up to you to choose.

SHITTY VALUES:
This is a list of values that create really poor problems (meaning sucky ones, not fulfilling)
1. Pleasure, making it the center of your existence. Pleasure is not the cause of happiness, rather it is an effect.
2. Material Success, pretty self-explanatory, i think having enough is enough.
3. Always being right, this pretty much keeps you from learning and growing. Not ideal.
4. Staying always positive, i imaging not leting yourself feel stuff cant be very useful.

OK, but if these values ARE shitty, what values are not shitty? Whan can i revolve my life around?

DEFINING GOOD AND BAD VALUES:
>> Good values are:
    1. Reality based
    2. Socially constructive
    3. Immediate and controllable

>> Bad values are:
    1. Supersticious
    2. Not socially constructive
    3. Not immediate and not controllable
