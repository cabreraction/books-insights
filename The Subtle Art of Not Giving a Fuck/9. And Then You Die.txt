AND THEN YOU DIE
>> If there is not a reason to do anything, there's also not a reason not do anything.
>> Death is what gives meaning to any of the shit we do.

SOMETHING BEYONG OURSELVES
>> Humans are unique in that we're the only animals that can conceptualize and think about ourselves abstractly. We are the only ones that can picture a reality in which we do not exist.
>> We have two selves, one that is physical and one that is conceptual. Because we are afraid of diying we try to construct a self that will live forever.
>> Accepting that we are temporary we can choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality, and freed from dangerous dogmatic views.

THE SUNNY SIDE OF DEATH 
>> Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy, fragile, superficial values in life.
>> What kind of life would justify diying?
>> You too are going to die, and that's because you too were fortunate enough to have lived.
