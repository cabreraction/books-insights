>> We are not all exceptional. Feeling good about yourself doesn't really mean anything unless you have a good reason to feel good about yourself.

>> Adversity and failure are useful and necessary for developing strong-minded and succesful adults.

>> Entitlement is the belief that you should have access to so and so without actually doing nothing and taking no action. Entitlement makes people need to 
feel good about themselves all the time, this is hard, it takes a lot of energy to convince yourself that your shit doesn't stink.

==== Do i feel like i'm entitled to anything? Am i blind to a weakness of mine? Do i expect results without putting in the effort?


THINGS FALL APART:
>> Suffering a trauma, going through problems that we feel are too big for us to solve can cause us to be entitled.
    "I'm awesome and the rest of you all suck, so I deserve special treatment"
    "I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment"

>> If you have got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future. This doesn't mean the problem sucks
but it does mean that you're not special, so you gotta deal with it the way non special people would.


THE TYRANNY OF EXCEPTIONALISM
>> Basically, social media does more harm than good, you should quit it, and if you don't at least have in mind that what you see are exceptions and not the rule.


WHAT'S THE POINT THEN?
>> Your actions actually don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things.
>> The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that's ok.
>> You need to do things because you want to do them, for you. Not for what you saw on social media or because you want people to see how well you're doing.
>> Maybe ordinary things are ordinary for a reason, maybe they're ordinary because they are what actually matters.
