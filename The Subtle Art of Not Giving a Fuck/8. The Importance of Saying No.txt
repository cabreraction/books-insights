THE IMPORTANCE OF SAYING NO:
>> Freedom grants the opportunity for greater meaning, but by itself there is nothing necessarily meaningul bout it. Absolute freedom, by itself, means nothing.
>> The only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance in one's life is through a rejection of alternatives, a norowing of freedom, a choice of commitment to one place, 
one belief or one person.

REJECTION MAKES YOUR LIFE BETTER:
>> If there is no hierarchy of values we live a life without any purpose.
>> To truly appreciate something, you must confine yourself to it. That is, you need to reject the alternatives.
>> You need to get comfortable saying no. Rejecting what is not valuable to you.

BOUNDARIES:
>> The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) How well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 
2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner.
>> This means, you solve your own problems, not your partners problems.
>> Entitled people fall into one of two traps in their relationships: Either they expect other people to take responsibility for their problemsor they take on too much 
responsibility for other people's problems.
>> You need to remember that you're the only person responsible for yourself. Now, this doesn't mean you can't ask for help.
>> You should support people because you choose to and not because you feel obligated or because you expect them to do the same thing for you.
>> Remember, you're not a victim, you're also not a saviour. You're just you, you've got your own problems and values, and you live with em.
>> Acts of love are valid only if they're performed without conditions or expectations.
>> Unconditional love is not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about; it's about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the gucks he or she gives.

HOW TO BUILD TRUST:
>> Honesty is more important than always feeling good.
>> Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally and ho is just there for the benefits.
>> Building trust takes tame and a track record. Actions ALWAYS win over words.

FREEDOM THROUGH COMMITMENT:
>> More is not always better. We're actuall often happier with less.
>> Commitment brings uncertainty about the options abandoned. This is ok, you need to feel comfortable with uncertainty.
>> Commitment gives you freedom because you're no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous.
>> Commitment makes decision-making easier and removes any fear of missing out.
>> Potential is good for discovering what is important to you, but the gold is in the choosing, in the abandonment of the potential for commitment.
