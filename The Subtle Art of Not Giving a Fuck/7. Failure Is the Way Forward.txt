FAILURE IS THE WAY FORWARD:
>> When you're a failure things can only get better (Well, this really depends, you can always make things worst).

THE FAILURE/SUCCESS PARADOX:
>> Success is composed of thousands of tiny little failures and mistakes.
>> To avoid failure is in itself a form of failure, cause you can't grow without failure.
>> Growth is about the process, not about the achievements. That is how it is supposed to be, you only get stuck if you avoid the process. Goals and values need be 
oriented to the process, not to the achievement itself, cause that will be over one day.

PAIN IS PART OF THE PROCESS:
>> Pain is the single most powerful motivator for change. Pain is what makes you question your values and ask "Why is this not working?".
>> Pain is necessary, is like failure, without pain there is no growth. Pain is not something to be avoided alltoguether.
>> You need to learn to sustain the pain you've chosen. Savor it. Welcome it with open arms. Act despite it.

THE "DO SOMETHING" PRINCIPLE:
>> "Action isn't just the effect of motivation; it's also the cause of it."
>> Inspiration -> Motivation -> Action -> Inspiration -> Motivation -> Action ......
>> Change it to: Action -> Inspiration -> Motivation -> Action -> Inspiration -> Motivation ....
>> By remaining in action failure feels unimportant.
