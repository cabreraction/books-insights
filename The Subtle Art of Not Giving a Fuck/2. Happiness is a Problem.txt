>>> Life itself is a form of suffering, no matter the situation you're in, you will suffer one way or another.
    The secret lies in embracing this fact: You will never cease to suffer, but that doesn't make life any less valuable.

>>> Pain and suffering are useful. They are the best motivators to take action. This includes phisical pain, but 
    in the human context psychological pain is the one that makes more sense as a motivator to take action. 

>>> Life is essentialy a series of problems.

>>> A good, meaningful life comes from solving problems. Constantly. Again and again, because that's how we move
    and that's how is supposed to be. Though problems do get upgraded, they become better problems to solve. 

>>> Denial (Making as if problems don't exist) and a victim mentality (believing you don't have what it takes 
    to solve your problems) is what make people miserable. And that is bad. Suffering is to make you happy, not 
    miserable.

>>> Emotions are overrated. They should not be trusted as evidence to make choices, specially not important ones, 
    this is because emotions come and go. They are just suggestions and they can be useful, but you cannot base 
    your decisions just on emotions.

>>> Choose your struggle. They joy is in the climb, so you gotta love the process, because attaining things is not 
    whats gonna make you stop being miserable, is the struggle itself. Building yourself day by day to be stronger 
    and a better version of yourself. So if you're only thinking about the result but you're not really enjoying 
    the ride, then the result is not gonna make you fell different. You'll stay miserable.
