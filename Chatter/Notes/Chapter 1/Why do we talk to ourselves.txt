* Minds are avid time travelers, time traveling allows us to make sense of experiences and make plans
for the future

* Most of the time we think about ourselves, theres nothing wrong about this, is completely normal, it 
is the default nature of the default state.

* The inner voice has survived because it adds up, otherwise evolution would have gotten rid of it.
