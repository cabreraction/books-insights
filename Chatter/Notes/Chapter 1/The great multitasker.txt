* Brains are multitaskers, the same part can and is used for different and unrelated tasks.

* The inner voice is connected to working memory. Working memory is like ram, only stores 
information that is immediately useful and then it forgets it, that is fine.

* We learn self control by language, as we are kids this is done out loud, as we grow older 
this is controlled by our inner voice. 

* Inner voices also alert and remind us about our goals and objectives. 

* Inner voice appears as spontaneuos thoughts, the same thing happens with dreams.

* Our inner voice is how we build the narrative of who we are and our lives, our identity.
