* We make sense of our feelings by communicating, though we most of the time are not aware that we're doing that.
* We also make sense by looking for information.
* Seems to me like communication can become a positive feedback loop (this being a negative thing in this case).

* What is Catharsis?
    - Purging yourself from your emotions after a tragic event.

* The behavior of expressing your emotions or chatter is belived to come from when we are babies (we cry every
time we need something and only stop after that need is met).
* So basically, we express our chatter in hope that someone will solve our problems? But this can rarely happen
making extreme expression not a good idea and usually with negative impact.

>>> THE CO-RUMINATION TRAP
    - When it comes to stress and problems we need to satisfy two needs: emotional and cognitive.
    - Talking to people can help us meet our emotional needs.
    - Cognitive needs mean finding actual solutions for our problems. (Maybe that's why guys like JP are so popular?)
    - Co-rumination is when we have to relive our experience in order to communicate it to others, this makes us
    relive our feelings, emotions and experiences. (Which could be a good thing if we're talking about something 
    positive).
    - One bad experience relived can trigger the reliving of another, this is associationism.

>>> KIRK OF SPOCK?
    - When supporting others we need to offer or provide emotional and cognitive comfort or options.
    - Time plays a role in this. People prefer not to cognitively reframe their feelings during the very
    height of an emotional experience.
    - Best support networks are built upon diversity. 
    - Would it be best if you focused more on cognitive needs rather than emotional? 
    - You gotta go to someone specialized, or become that someone.

>>> INVISIBLE SUPPORT 
    - Trying to give unsolicited advice is not always a good idea. Giving advice at the wrong time can backfire.
    - Giving unsolicited help can damage the persons sence of sel-efficacy.
    - Invisible-Support is when we help someone without them noticing. Or maybe indirectly.
    - Touch is one of the most basic tools that we use to help those we care about turn a negative internal dialog
    around. It is inseparable from infance.
