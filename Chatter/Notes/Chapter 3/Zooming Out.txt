* We can think of the mind as a lens and our inner voice as a button that zooms it either in or out.
* Zooming in means that we loose perspective. this happens when we let chatter take the lead. Zooming in
    is not a bad thing in and of itself, the problem comes when we cant zoom out again.
* Its a positive feedback loop. 
* Our mind has a psychological immune system: we can use our thoughs to change our thoughts. -- By adding distance.
* Distance doesnt solver our problems, but it increases the likelihood that we can.

>> WHEN CHATTER STRIKES, HOW DO WE GAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE?
Rather, how can we think about problems without letting rumination start or control us?
    - Distraction: just symptomatic fix, short-term
    - Distancing: Engage with your thoughts from a distanced perspective, perharps as if you were someone else.

    >> DISTANCING:
        * Visualizing: See the past in third person.
        * Zooming out shortens both negative and positive experiences. If you want to preserve positive experiencies
            you need to be a third person watching.
        * Distancing in summary is a way to learn to control ourselves in every aspect.
        * HELPFUL FOR DESITION MAKING!!

>> SOLOMON'S PARADOX
Solomon was very wise in other's peoples matters, but in his own life he ended up losing everything.
    * We don't see ourselves with the same distance and insight with which we see others.

>> TIME TRAVEL AND THE POWER OF THE PEN 
    * Looking back enough can fix the present, or at least, how we feel about it.
