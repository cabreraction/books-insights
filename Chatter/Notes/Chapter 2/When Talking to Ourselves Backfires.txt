* Your voice can build you, but it can also destroy you, fast.
* What should you do when the voice is trying to destroy you?

>> Unlinking the Magical Number Four
    * Attention is a Filter, it helps us focus on what matters and ignore what doesn't.
    * Humans have the ability to choose to concentrate on give tasks.
    * Unlinking happens when a skill that you have learned and automated gets thrown back
      to the realm of attention, where you conciously need to think about it. If this happens 
      is like starting over.
    * If you're trying to focus or work deep you need your inner voice to work with you, if 
      is focused on other stuff it is going to be next to impossible to really concentrate.

>> A Social Repellent
    * Chatter could potentially makes us obsesed over negative experiences and annoy people around us.
    * Rumination is the process of repeating the same thought (often dark, sad or angry). Voicing this 
    thoughts often leads to social rejection (relationships thrive on reciprocity and humans have a limit
    to the amount of venting they can support).
    * We vent because we're searching for empathy (we feel like victims)
    * We should give time to our thoughts before we start sharing or venting.
    * Depression is fueled by the verbal stream (Does that mean that if you stop talking so much about your
    problems you're gonna be less depressed?)
    * Chatter has physical negative implications on us as well.

>> The Piano Inside Our Cells
    * Stress stops being useful when it becomes chronic.
    * How we talk to ourselves has an effect on our genes expression, chatter can supress the ones that 
    take care of us (like stress stops non critical functions to power boost others). This is useful on 
    the short term but very damaging on the long term.
    * Basically, chatter can make you sick and kill you.

>> Asset or Liability?
    Our inner voice can be both, its up to use which one we use and rely on.
