* Calling yourself by your own name, as if you're someone else talking to yourself.

>>> GET TO IT, FRED
    When under stressful situations people often ask themselves two questions:
        1. What is required of me in these circumstances?
        2. Do i have the personal resources to cope with what's required?
    If we conclude that we don't have whats needed to succeed, we perceive the situation as a threat, on the other
    hand if we conclude that we do have what it takes we end up perceiving it as a challenge.
    - Viewving things as challenges help us achieve better results and be more prepared. Distance self-talking
    is related to perceiving situations as challenges, while immersed self-talking is connected to perceiving
    stuations as threats.


>>> THE UNIVERSAL 'YOU'
    * There is a potent psychological comfort that comes from normalizing experiences (if other people got 
    through this hardship, then so can i).
    * Generic or universal 'you'. This practice generalizes situations, normalizing them.
    * Feeling supported is not the same as feeling better or relieved.
