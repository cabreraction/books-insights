Grand Gestures
    * these help to let your mind know that what you're doing is important, thats the basic idea.

Dont Work Alone
    * Basically the idea is about colaboration, that networking boosts creativity.
    * It seems to me tho, that you should collaborate with people that are as commited to work as you are.
    * You cannot spend all of your time collaborating, you nee time to work deeply on your own.
    * You also need to take into consideration what type of work you are doing. Innovation makes use of 
    collaboration more than other types of work.
    * When you're collaborating, collaborate, when you're working, work.
    * Be balanced, dont do it unless you're seeing results.

Execute Like a Business
    * you know the 'what' but you got to find out the 'how'
    
    1. Focus On The Wildly important
        - But you got to be specific about this, a simple goal will help you stay focus 
        and accomplish more
    2. Act on Lead Measures
        - Basically, work on the things that you cant controll and 
        let that make the changes you want to see.
        - Time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal
    3. Keep a Compeling Scoreboard
        - This is just for motivation, having something that you could see and see all the progress 
        that you're making
    4. Create a Cadence of Accountability
        - Check that you're sticking to your commitments, reflect on what you have to change 
        to be able to stick to them. Plan ahead.

Be Lazy
    * Regularly inject periods of freedom from professional responsabilities.
    * Once you're done, you're done, no more concerning of responsabilities.
    1. Your brain keeps working in the background
    2. You need to rest to be able to concentrate again (attention is not unlimited)
    3. Since attention is not unlimited the work that you can get done is not so meaningful
