>>>> DRAIN THE SHALLOWS
    * Basically: If you eliminated significant amounts of shallow work your bottom line remains unaffected.
        So the principle is to change this for deep work.
    * Things to consider: shallow work is necessary, so you shouldnt eliminate it alltoguether.
    * There is a limit to deep work, if you go over the limit you're likely to see dimishing rewards.


>>>>> SCHEDULE EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAY
    * Schedule by bloks, every minute of your work day should be part of a block.
    * Adapt and rewrite as needed
    * The goal is not to maintain a tight schedule all day, rather it is to maintain a thoughful say
        in what you're doing with your time.
    * Schedules should allow spontaneity.


>>>>> QUANTIFY THE DEPTH OF EVERY ACTIVITY
    * Ask this about every task: How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate
        with no specialized training in my field to complete this task.
    * Once you divide your tasks bias your times towards the deep tasks.


>>>>> ASK YOUR BOSS FOR A SHALLOW WORK BUDGET
    * Stablish the ratio of shallow work in your work week and then dont go over it.


>>>>> FINISH YOUR WORK BY FIVE THIRTY
    * Fixed-Schedule productivity.
    * Say no to shallow opportunities and dont offer consolation prices when you say no.
    * If you reduce your shallow work you'll have more energy during your deep work periods.


>>>>> BECOME HARD TO REACH
    * Resistnce is not futile
    > Make people who send you email do more work
        - Basically condition your responses to what the sender sends.
    > Do more work when you send or reply to emails
        - When you do reply to emails and stuff, plan it so that you minimize the number of interactions.
            This means that you should outline a process of the project in hand and discuss it the 
            all the parts.
    > Don't Respond
        - It's the senders responsability to convince the receiver that they deserve a response.
        - Do not reply if nothing bad would happen if you didnt of nothing good would happen if you did.
        - Do not reply if its not a question or proposal that interests you.
        - Do not reply if the email is ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate
            a reasonable response.

** "Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don't, you'll never find time for the
life-changing big things"
