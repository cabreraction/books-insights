* You cannot get the most out of your deep working time if the rest of the time you spend it overstimulated,
giving in to any distraction. This causes chorical distraction - ness.

* In order to learn how to concentrate deeply you need to learn two skills:
    1. Improving your ability to concentrate intensely
    2. Overcoming your desire for distraction

>>>>>>> DONT TAKE BREAKS FROM DISTRACTION. INSTEAD TAKE BREAKS FROM FOCUS
This strategy is designed to help you rewire your brain to a configuration better suited to staying
on task.

* Learn to have a  disconnectedness within the connected world, dont run away.
* Internet Sabbath (Basically the same as sabbath, just from the internet, detox your brain).
* Schedule when you will use social media (no other time is allowed, only during the scheduled times).

* POINT 1: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of internet use and/or prompt email replies
* POINT 2: Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks
absolutely free from Internet use.
* POINT 3: Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration 
training.

 -----> The main lesson is that you dont need to eliminate distracting behaviors, you just need to 
        elimiate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention

>>>>>>>> WORK LIKE TEDDY ROOSEVELT
According to the reading teddy was crazy, has a lot of diverse interests and was quite good at everything.
He didnt spend a lot of time studying, but when he did it was intense.

* Work with timers, i can see how this helps. For example when im taking a test it is most of the times a 
timed test and because of this most of the times i'm deeply engaged.
* At first try this no more than once a week.

>>>>>>>>> MEDITATE PRODUCTIVELY
Basically, use the time that you're phisically but not mentally occupied to work on a single thought or
problem that you need to solve.

* If your mind wanders you have to bring yourself back to the problem.
* The goal is not to be more productive, the goal is to learn to think deeply.
* CHANGE AND DEVELOPING ABILITIES TAKE TIME!!!

* SUGGESTION 1: Be Wary of Distractions and Looping
* SUGGESTION 2: Structure Your Deep Thinking
