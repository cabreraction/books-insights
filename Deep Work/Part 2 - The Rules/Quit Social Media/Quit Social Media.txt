* Benefits of network tools are at best minor and random.
* Network tools have pros and cons, but one usually never really evaluates the cons. Don't rely on the 
any-benefit approach (you should use it if it adds any value despite the cons).

    Identify the core factors that determine success and happines in your professional and personal life.
    Adopt a tool only if it's possible impacts on these factors substantially outweight it's negative 
    impacts.
